## Installation

## API documentation

1. Retrieve a list of all cars in the database. This endpoint provides a comprehensive overview of available car data.

```bash
GET /cars
```

2. Retrieve detailed information about a specific car model. Returns data including manufacturer, model, and image URL. If the car model is not found, a 404 error is returned.

```bash
GET /cars/:model
```

3. Create a new car entry by providing the car model, manufacturer, and image URL. Successful addition results in a 200 OK response, while missing fields trigger a 400 Bad Request error.

```bash
POST /cars
```

4. Change the model of a car by providing the new model in the request body. Receives a 200 OK on success, or returns a 400 Bad Request for incomplete requests or a 404 Not Found if the car model is not found.

```bash
PUT /cars/:model
```

5. Delete a car by specifying its model. Returns a 200 OK if successful, or a 404 Not Found if the car model is not present.
